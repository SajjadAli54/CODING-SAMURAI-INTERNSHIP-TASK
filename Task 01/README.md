# Task 01

**Project Title**: Predicting Flower Species

**Project Description**: In this project, you will create a simple machine learning model to
predict the species of flowers based on their features. You can use the famous Iris
dataset, which contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal
length, and petal width) for three different species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and
virginica).

```sh
python main.py --sepal_length 5.1 --sepal_width 3.5 --petal_length 1.4 --petal_width 0.2
```
